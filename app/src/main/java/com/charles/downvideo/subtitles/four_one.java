    [SARAH] It's beautiful, Mark.
    VM9642:6 [MARK] I am so tired.
    VM9642:6 [MARK] Can you drive?
    VM9642:6 [MARK] What's that supposed to mean?
    VM9642:6 [SARAH] I mean, I can drive. But there?
    VM9642:6 [SARAH] I'm sorry, Mark. I can drive, but I'm not very good at it.
    VM9642:6 [MARK] Sarah, I like driving. But it's tiring.
    VM9642:6 [MARK] I can't do it every day.
    VM9642:6 [SARAH] OK.
            VM9642:6 [MARK] Let's try.
    VM9642:6 [MARK] Are you OK?
    VM9642:6 [MARK] Mm-hmm.
            VM9642:6 [MARK] Let's... uhh ... let's go that way.
    VM9642:6 [SARAH] OK.
            VM9642:6 [SARAH] Sorry.
            VM9642:6 [SARAH] I love driving at home in England.
            VM9642:6 [SARAH] It's fun.
    VM9642:6 [SARAH] But here in the US? I don't know.
    VM9642:6 [SARAH] In the UK, we drive on the left side of the road. Not the right.

     [TODD] Sally. Could you do me a favor?
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Sure. What do you need?
    VM9642:6 [TODD] Well, Angela and I want to do something special this weekend. It’s our 20th wedding anniversary.
            VM9642:6 [SALLY] Wow! Twenty years together. Congratulations.
            VM9642:6 [TODD] Thanks. The thing is, we don’t go out a lot, and I really don’t know ...
    VM9642:6 [TODD] Could you help me find something interesting?
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Sure. Um, no problem.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Springdale.com has all the events listed for the city.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] It covers the concert hall, the auditorium ... You really should check it out.
    VM9642:6 [TODD] That’s a good idea.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] There’s an incredible samba band at the Blue Banana.
            VM9642:6 [SALLY] That’s the hottest nightclub in town right now. Do you and Angela like to dance?
    VM9642:6 [TODD] Hmm. I really don’t dance. Is there something a little more, kind of ...
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Traditional.
            VM9642:6 [TODD] Yes! Like a classical concert. Beethoven. Or Mozart.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Here’s a play. How about Shakespeare? It’s 'Hamlet.'
    VM9642:6 [TODD] Hmm. That’s more like it.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] It’s in the Main Street Theater on Saturday.
    VM9642:6 [TODD] Angela loves plays. Thank you so much!
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] You’re welcome!


        //4.3
        [SALLY] Oh! There’s a samba band at, uh ...
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Nah. I can’t dance to samba.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] You can’t dance to anything.
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] What?
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Why don’t we go to that new sports bar on, uh, Grove Street?
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Harmon’s?
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Yeah! They’re probably showing the football game.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] I hate sports bars.
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Really? Why?
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Because they’re boring. The music’s always so loud, it’s difficult to have a conversation.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] How about a quiet, relaxing dinner with Pam and Simon?
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] We do that every night.
            VM9642:6 [SALLY] Okay. You’re right. Let’s do something different.
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] I know! Let’s go to a movie. 'The New York Killer.'
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] A horror movie? I don’t think so. How about a romance, or a drama?
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Ugh.
            VM9642:6 [JAKE] Ugh.
            VM9642:6 [JAKE] Hey, look! They’re playing 'Chinatown' at the Roxie Theater.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Really? It’s a classic!
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Yeah. I saw it years ago. It was incredible.
            VM9642:6 [SALLY] I’d love to see it again. Can you book the tickets?
    VM9642:6 [JAKE] Sure thing.
    VM9642:6 [SALLY] Thanks, Jake. I’m gonna go get ready.
            VM9642:6 [JAKE] Okay.
